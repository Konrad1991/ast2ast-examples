# ast2ast Examples

This repository contains examples and tutorials for the `ast2ast` package, which is used in conjunction with `r2sundials` and `paropt` to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and optimize their parameters.
Moreover, one example demonstrates the optimization of a loss function using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

The rendered tutorials can be found [here](https://konrad1991.github.io/ast2ast-examples/)
